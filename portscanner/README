# ECE303 Communication Networks - Project 1: Port Scanner
## Written by Jon Lu 03/09/2021

## About
This project scans a given IPv4 hostname and checks which ports are open. Default ports scanned are 1 through 1024, though it can be changed by declaring [lowerport upperport]. The program will also report what service should be expected on the port with getservbyport(). 

Written for `python3`.
